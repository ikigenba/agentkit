# AgentKit — Plan Status

The manifest. One line per phase, in build order — the **only** place a phase's status marker lives. Each phase line begins with the literal word `Phase` and carries a done-marker (U+2705) or not-started-marker (U+2B1C). The build loop finds the next work with `grep -nE '^Phase .* ⬜' docs/plan/STATUS.md | head -1`, reads only that phase's `docs/plan/phase-NN.md`, and on completion flips that phase's one marker here to done. Nothing else in this file or any phase file is edited at build time. Append a new line (and a new phase file) to extend. (This paragraph deliberately carries no bare status glyph, so the anchored grep matches only phase lines.)

Phase 18  ✅  realizes D9,D12                          — Fix: shared `internal/openaicompat` replayed tool-call `arguments` serialized as object, not string
Phase 19  ✅  realizes D9                              — Fix: Google adapter drops co-resident `functionCall`/text when a part carries a `thoughtSignature`
Phase 20  ✅  realizes D9                              — Fix: Google adapter nests the replayed `thoughtSignature` inside `functionCall` instead of on the part
